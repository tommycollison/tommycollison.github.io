<h1>Great Books Program</h1>
<p>November 2020</p>

    <p><em>“I certainly understand the value of knowing key ideas from different disciplines and building my own latticework, but I didn’t learn any of that in school, and I’d be starting from ground zero."</em><br><br>
        Charlie Munger, quoted in Robert Hagstrom's <em>Investing: The Last Liberal Art</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>What we traditionally call a liberal arts (and classic literature) education has moral, civic, social, economic, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">progress-related</a> benefits. Benjamin Franklin, looking around at education opportunities in the 18th century, was disappointed by the lack of practical skills being taught, which he saw as being necessary to be successful in business and the public sphere. Here's Robert Hagstrom again:</p> 

<h3>The plan:</h3>

<p>To read roughly 100 classic works in the next five years. I'm giving myself one year more than students at St John's College (apparently called Johnnies, which I love) because I have a day job and other hobbies, but I think roughly 20 classic books a year is a fair pace.</li>
    
<div id="blockquote">
    "Almost all kinds of useful knowledge would be learned through reading of history," wrote Franklin. But he meant much more than the definition we customarily attach to a history discipline; for Franklin, "history" encompassed all that is meaningful and worthwhile. By encouraging young men to read history, Franklin meant for them to learn philosophy, logic, mathematics, religion, government, law, chemistry, biology, health, agriculture, physics, and foreign languages. To those who wondered whether such a burdensome task was really necessary, Franklin replied that it was not a burden to learn but a gift. If you read the universal histories, he said, "it would give you a connected idea of human affairs."
</div>

<p>I put this project together out of a desire to read broadly from great works of philosophy, religion, political science, psychology, history, economics, math, chemistry, physics, and biology. I know myself well enough to know that I need both structure and rigor if I'm going to get anything done. That's why this page exists.</p>

<p>Beyond Franklin, this project has two inspirations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Graham Allison and Niall Fergon's idea of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">"Applied History,"</a> and</p>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi">Daf Yomi</a>, the Jewish tradition in which people read the (roughly) 2,700 pages of the Babylonian Talmud in (roughly) seven-and-a-half years.</p>
</ul>


<h3>Questions</h3>
<p><b>Can I suggest a book you should include?</b></li>
<p>Please do! You can <a href="mailto:tommy+greatbooks@collison.ie">send me an email</a> or find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tommycollison">Twitter</a>.</li>

<p><b>What are you reading currently?</b></p>
<p>I'm about to get started! First up: Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>. (I'll update this as I go.)</li>

<p><b>Can I join?</b></p>
<p>Yes, with the caveat that I don't know what a group doing this would look like. I have a couple of ideas though -- stay tuned. If you'd like to join me for a book or two, drop me a line at the links above!</p>

<p><b>Are you going to document or write about the books as you go?</b></p>
<p>Probably, with the caveat that I don't know how, exactly. I might just take notes for myself, I might write things based on what I learn, or I might keep a running commentary. Not sure yet.</p>

<p><b>How did you choose which books to include?</b></li>
<p>I used the <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/great-books-reading-list">St John's College</a> list, and then made a handful of additions and subtractions.</p>
