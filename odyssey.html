<h1>Homer: The Odyssey</h1>
<p>Finished in November 2020.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Translation notes: I read the (excellent) Emily Wilson's new translation and listened, in some parts, to W. H. D. Rouse's.</li>
    <li>Really enjoyed how I knew a bunch of the stories before -- shout-out to Andrew Sachs narrating an audiobook of Greek myths that I had circa 2004. C.f. Odysseus' interactions with Polyphemus, the cyclops, and the scene with the sirens.</li>
    <li>Odysseus is pleasantly... human. We have so much evidence of his ingenuity and shrewdness, while he’s also… a rash dude whose mouth gets him into trouble.</li>
    <li>Fun to have a view of gods who aren’t distant or on high, but who pick favorites and seem very interested in humans affairs.</li>
</ul>
